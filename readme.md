#OmegleGroup
its like a group chat but on omegle haha

i fucked around on this with some random omegle people and they got so confused but there was this one girl i met who was really nice and i liek her

ummmm to run just like `git clone https://github.com/RoseChilds/omegleGroup` and then `cd omegleGroup`

then like `npm i`

ok so then you gotta run the server with `node server/index.js`

this is important because without the server the clients are lost

make sure port 3000 is open

ok so then you gotta open one client for the amount of people you want in the chat, so lets say three

just run `node client/index.js` three times and each client will connect to an omegle server and your omeglegroup server and then find random people from the music tag to put in the group chat

its funny i think
